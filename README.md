# jdbc-tutorial-database-utility-class
The project provides a custom utility class that simplifies database operations and 
provides central control of database connection lifecycle and usage.

### Before You Start
Make sure that you configure the properties in the 
`src\main\java\resources\database.properties` so that they match your settings.  

The database schema generation is automated. 

Testcontainers are used for testing, therefore you should have Docker open for running the tests.
